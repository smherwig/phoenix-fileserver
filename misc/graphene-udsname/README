Graphene maps UNIX domain sockets to an alternative namespace.  In particular,
the UNIX domain socket path is hashed, and the resulting path is 'abstract'
(begins with a nul byte), and has the form:

    snprintf("%s%08x", pal_sec.pipe_prefix, pipeid)

where pipe_prefix is the empty string by default, and pipeid is the pathname
hash.  I think that pipe_prefix is probably used to group family's of libOS
processes.

The hashing function is not familiar to me.
